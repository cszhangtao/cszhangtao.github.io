Dr. Tao Zhang is a Full Professor at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST)](https://www.must.edu.mo/en), Macau SAR. He received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Seoul under the supervision of Prof. Byungjeong Lee. After that, he spent one year at the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/) as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow, as advised by [Prof. Xiapu Luo](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csxluo/). He received his bachelor's degree in Automation and master's degree in Software Engineering from Northeastern University, China.

Tao is a senior member of ACM and IEEE. He serves/served as General or Program Chair for numerous academic conferences, including APSEC 2025, Internetware 2024, SANER 2023, and DSA 2021. He also serves as a PC member for several top-tier SE conferences, including ICSE, FSE, ASE, and ISSTA. He is an Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE) and the Journal of Systems and Software (JSS). He is also an Editorial Board Member for Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) and Science of Computer Programming (SCP).

His current research interests include AI for Software Engineering, Software Security, and Mining Software Repositories. He published more than 100 high-quality papers in renowned software engineering and security journals and conferences such as ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ASE, TSE, TOSEM, EMSE, TIFS, and TDSC.
