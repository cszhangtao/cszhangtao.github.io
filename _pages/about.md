I received my B.S. in Automation and M.Eng in Software Engineering from Northeastern University, China. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the [University of Seoul](https://english.uos.ac.kr/), under the supervision of Prof. Byungjeong Lee. After that, I spent one year at the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/) as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow advised by Prof. Xiapu Luo. Currently, I am an associate professor at the School of Computer Science and Engineering (Former Faculty of Information Technology), [Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST)](https://www.must.edu.mo/en). 

My current research interests include AI for Software Engineering, Mining Software Repositories, and Software Security.

I am looking for highly motivated Postdoctoral Research Fellows/Research Assistants and Ph.D./MPhil students with strong backgrounds in Data Mining, Artificial Intelligence, Software Security, and Software Engineering. Undergraduate students who are interested in my research are also welcome to join us.
